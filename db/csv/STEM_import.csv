"Urban Teacher Residency United","Aspire Teacher Residency","Oakland, CA","March 2, 2012","Urban Teacher Residency United (UTRU) is a national network of teacher residency programs with an organizational emphasis and expertise on the key elements of high quality, clinical-based teacher preparation, including: clinical preparation, especially the residency preparation model; strategic recruitment; new teacher support through mentoring and induction; and partnership building with districts to target placement in high-needs subject areas and schools.

Teacher residencies are exemplar programs encompassing the core elements of quality teacher preparation.  The residency model plays an important role in comprehensive human capital strategies and reform efforts by creating deliberate pathways for responding to the hiring needs of high-need school districts, providing career advancement for experienced teachers to act as mentors, and developing highly effective new teachers to improve instruction and increase student achievement.

The residency model blends a rigorous full-year classroom apprenticeship with a carefully aligned sequence of academic coursework.  Residents learn by teaching alongside a trained mentor teacher in the same high-need district in which they will work.  Coursework is tailored to district needs, so residents learn the district's instructional initiatives and curriculum and come to understand the history and context of the local community. Teacher residency programs require candidates commit to teach for a minimum of 3 years.
